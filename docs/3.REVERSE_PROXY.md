### 1. What is Reverse Proxy
- Delivers requests from a client to a server and sends responses back to the client on behalf of the server
> clients -> reverse proxy -> real server

### 2. How it Works
- A user sends a request to `https://example.com`
- This request is sent to a reverse proxy first
- The reverse proxy reads a content of the request and sends to the appropriate server
- When the server sends response to the reverse proxy, the reverse proxy than forwards the response back to the client

### 3. Key Function of Reverse Proxy
|function|description|
|--|--|
|Protect Server|A client never knows the real server’s IP address and can only access the proxy server|
|Load Balancing|Distributes traffic to multiple servers|
|Caching|Decreases the burden of server by caching frequently requested responses|
|SSL Termination|Processes HTTPS encryption and decryption at the proxy so that servers can communicate over HTTP|
|Static Serving|Nginx serves static resources such as images, CSS, JS on behalf of the server|
|Filter request/response|Modifies or filters requests and responses, such as adding headers or rewriting URLs|

### 4. Merit of Reverse Proxy
|merit|description|
|--|--|
|Security|Does not directly expose internal servers to the external network|
|Enhanced Performance|Caching, Static Serving, compression(Gzip, Brotli)|
|Flexible Scalability|Distributes traffic to multiple servers|
|SSL Central Management|Manages certificates in one place|
|Easy Response to Failures|Requests can be forwarded to another server in case of a specific server failure.|
