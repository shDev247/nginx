### 1. What Is Forward Proxy
- A forward proxy sends requests to servers on behalf of clients.
- It is located between clients (users) and the Internet (external servers).
> client -> `forward proxy` -> external server

### 2. How It Works
1. A client doesn't send requests to an external server directly. Instead, sends requests to a proxy server.
2. The proxy server receives these requests, forwards them to the external server, and then delivers the responses back to the client.
3. As a result, the external server never knows the real client’s IP address; it only sees the proxy server’s IP address.

### 3. Key Functions of Forward Proxy
