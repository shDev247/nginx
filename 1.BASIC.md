### 1. What Is NGINX?
- Nginx is a **high-performance open-source software**.
- It provides functions such as a web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, HTTP caching, and mail proxy.
- It efficiently handles hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections due to its **event-driven asynchronous architecture**.
- It is widely used in large-scale services that require high performance and stability.

### 2. Role of Nginx
- `Web Server` : Provides files that make up websites, such as HTML, CSS, JS and images.
- `Reverse Proxy` : Acts as an intermediary, receiving and delivering requests from clients on behalf of backend servers.
- `Load Balancer` : Distributes requests to mutiple servers so that burden is relieved and availability is enhanced.
- `Cashing` : Also acts as a proxy for mail protocols such as IMAP, POP3 and SMTP.
- `SSL/TLS Terminator` : Processes SSL/TLS encryption and decryption so that the web server's burden is relieved.
