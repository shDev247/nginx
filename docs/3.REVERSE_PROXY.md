### 1. What is Revers Proxy
- Delivers requests from a client to a server and send responses back to the client on behalf of the server.
> clients -> reverse proxy -> real server

### 2. How it Works
- A user sends a request to `https://example.com`
- This request sent to a reverse proxy first
- The reverse proxy reads a content of the request and sends to appropriate server
- When the server sends response to the reverse proxy, the reverse proxy sends response back to the client

### 3. Key Function of Reverse Proxy
|function|description|
|--|--|
|Protect Server|A client never knows real server's IP address, only can access to proxy server|
|Load Balancing|Distributes traffics to multiple servers|
|Caching|Decreases burden of server by caching frequently requested responses|
|SSL Termination|Processes HTTPS identification at proxy so that server can communication by HTTP|
|Static Serving|Nginx serves static resources such as images, CSS, JS onbehalf of server|
|Filter request/response|Modifies or filters requests, such as adding headers or rewriting URLs|

### 4. Merit of Reverse Proxy

|--|--|
|Security|Do not directly expose internal servers to external|
|Enhance Performance|Caching, Static Serving, compression(Gzip, Brotil)|
|Flexible scalability|Distributes traffics to multiple servers|
|SSL central management|Manages certificates in one place|
|Easy response to failures|Requests can be forwarded to another server in case of a specific server failure.|
